### About The Project


This is a simple web-application built with pure html/css/javascript.  
Its main idea is to share essential information about me, my decision to make a career switch into software development and my learning path towards Front-End Developer career as well as resources I used (and still using) during this journey. 
Since I'm interested in web-development and frontend, I mostly focused on CSS/HTML, Javascript. ReactJS is also on my radar, however not covered in this app.
