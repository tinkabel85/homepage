### About The Project


This is a simple web-application built on pure html/css/javascript.  
Its main idea is to share some information about me, my decision to make a career switch into software development and my learning path towards Front-End Developer career, while practicing my skills in front-end technologies. 
Since I chose web-development, I mostly focused on CSS/HTML, Javascript. ReactJS is also on my radar, however not covered on this app.
